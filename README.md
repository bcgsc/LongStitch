# LongStitch
A genome assembly correction and scaffolding pipeline using long reads, consisting of up to three steps:
* [Tigmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint) cuts the draft assembly at potentially misassembled regions
* [ntLink](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink) is then used to scaffold the corrected assembly
* followed by [ARKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/arcs) for further scaffolding (optional extra step of scaffolding)

### Dependencies
* [Tigmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint) v1.2.3+
* [ntLink](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink) v1.0.0+
* [ARCS/ARKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/arcs) v1.2.2+
* [ABySS](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss) v2.0.0+
* [LINKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/links) v1.8.5+
* [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)

### Example command
For example, to run the default pipeline on a draft assembly `draft-assembly.fa` with the reads `reads.fa.gz` and a genome size of `gsize`:
```
longstitch run draft=draft-assembly reads=reads G=gsize
```
Note that specifying `G` is required when `span=auto` for Tigmint-long.

The output scaffolds can be found in soft-links with the suffix `longstitch-scaffolds.fa`

### LongStitch demo
To test your LongStitch installation and see examples of how to run the pipeline, see `tests/run_longstitch_demo.sh`

To run the demo script, ensure all dependencies are in your PATH, and run the bash script:
```
cd tests
./run_longstitch_demo.sh
```

### Full help page
To run the LongStitch pipeline, you can use the Makefile driver script `longstitch`.
```
Usage: ./longstitch [COMMAND] [OPTION=VALUE]â€¦
	Commands:

	run     		run default LongStitch pipeline: Tigmint, then ntLink

	tigmint-ntLink-arks	run full LongStitch pipeline: Tigmint, ntLink, then ARCS in kmer mode
	tigmint-ntLink		run Tigmint, then ntLink (Same as 'run' target)
	ntLink-arks		run ntLink, then run ARCS in kmer mode

	General options (required):
	draft			draft name [draft]. File must have .fa extension
	reads			read name [reads]. File must have .fq.gz or .fa.gz extension

	General options (optional):
	t			number of threads [8]
	z			minimum size of contig (bp) to scaffold [1000]

	Tigmint options:
	span			min number of spanning molecules to be considered correctly assembled [auto]
	dist			maximum distance between alignments to be considered the same molecule [auto]
	G			haploid genome size (bp) for calculating span parameter. (e.g. '3e9' for human genome) [0]

	ntLink options:
	k_ntLink		k-mer size for minimizers [32]
	w			window size for minimizers [100]

	ARCS+LINKS options:
	j			minimum fraction of read kmers matching a contigId (used in kmer mode) [0.05]
	k_arks			size of a k-mer (used in kmer mode) [20]
	c			minimum aligned read pairs per molecule [4]
	l			minimum number of links to compute scaffold [4]
	a			maximum link ratio between two best contain pairs [0.3]

Notes:
	- by default, span is automatically calculated as 1/4 of the sequence coverage of the input long reads
	- G (genome size) must be specified if span=auto
	- by default, dist is automatically calculated as p5 of the input long read lengths
	- Ensure that all input files are in the current working directory, making soft-links if needed
