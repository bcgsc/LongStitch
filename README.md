# LongStitch
A long-read scaffolding pipeline that consists of three stages:
* [Tigmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint) cuts the draft assembly at potentially misassembled regions
* [ntLink](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink) is then used to scaffold the corrected assembly
* followed by [ARCS](https://github.com/bcgsc/arcs) for further scaffolding

### Dependencies
* [Tigmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint)
* [ntLink](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink)
* [ARCS](https://github.com/bcgsc/arcs)
* [ABySS](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss)
* [LINKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/links)

### Installation
```
cd src
make
```

### Usage
To run the LongStitch pipeline, you can use the Makefile driver script `longstitch`.
```
Usage: ./longstitch [COMMAND] [OPTION=VALUE]â€¦

Commands:
all     		run full LongStitch pipeline: Tigmint, ntLink, then ARCS
tigmint-ntLink-arks	run full LongStitch pipeline: Tigmint, ntLink, then ARKS
tigmint-ntLink		run Tigmint, then run ntLink with the output of Tigmint
tigmint-arcs		run Tigmint, then run ARCS in default mode with the output of Tigmint
tigmint-arks		run Tigmint, then run ARCS in kmer mode with the output of Tigmint
ntLink-arcs		run ntLink, then run ARCS in default mode with the output of ntLink
ntLink-arks		run ntLink, then run ARCS in kmer mode with the output of ntLink

General options (required):
draft			draft name [draft]. File must have .fa extension
reads			read name [reads]. File must have .fq.gz or .fa.gz extension

General options (optional):
t			number of threads [8]
z			minimum size of contig (bp) to scaffold [1000]

Tigmint options:
span			min number of spanning molecules to be considered correctly assembled [auto]
dist			maximum distance between alignments to be considered the same molecule [auto]
G			haploid genome size (bp) for calculating span parameter. (e.g. '3e9' for human genome) [-1]

ntLink options:
k_ntLink		k-mer size for minimizers [32]
w			window size for minimizers [100]

ARCS+LINKS options:
s			minimum sequence identity (used in default mode) [70]
j			minimum fraction of read kmers matching a contigId (used in kmer mode) [0.05]
k_arks			size of a k-mer (used in kmer mode) [20]
c			minimum aligned read pairs per molecule [4]
l			minimum number of links to compute scaffold [4]
a			maximum link ratio between two best contain pairs [0.3]

Notes:
	- by default, span is automatically calculated as 1/4 of the sequence coverage of the input long reads
	- by default, dist is automatically calculated as p5 of the input long read lengths
```

For example, to run the entire pipeline on a draft assembly `draft-assembly.fa` with the reads `reads.fa.gz` and a genome size of `gsize`:
```
longstitch all draft=draft-assembly reads=reads G=gsize
```
