# LongStitch
A genome assembly correction and scaffolding pipeline using long reads, consisting of up to three steps:
* [Tigmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint) cuts the draft assembly at potentially misassembled regions
* [ntLink](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink) is then used to scaffold the corrected assembly
* followed by [ARKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/arcs) for further scaffolding (optional extra step of scaffolding)

### Credits
LongStitch was developed and designed by Lauren Coombe, Janet Li, Theodora Lo and Rene Warren.

### Installing LongStitch

LongStitch is available from conda:
```
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge longstitch
```

All dependencies for LongStitch are also available from homebrew:
```
brew tap brewsci/bio
brew install tigmint ntlink arcs
```

Alternatively, use the latest release tarball:
```
wget https://github.com/bcgsc/LongStitch/releases/download/v1.0.4/longstitch-1.0.4.tar.gz
```

#### Dependencies
* GNU Make
* [Tigmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint) v1.2.4+
* [ntLink](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink) v1.3.3+
* [ARCS/ARKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/arcs) v1.2.5+
* [ABySS](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss) v2.3.0+

### Example command
For example, to run the default pipeline on a draft assembly `draft-assembly.fa` with the reads `reads.fa.gz` and a genome size of `gsize`:
```
longstitch run draft=draft-assembly reads=reads G=gsize
```
Note that specifying `G` is required when `span=auto` for Tigmint-long, and that all input sequences files should be in single-line fasta/fastq format.

The output scaffolds can be found in soft-links with the suffix `longstitch-scaffolds.fa`

### LongStitch demo
To test your LongStitch installation and see examples of how to run the pipeline, see `tests/run_longstitch_demo.sh`

To run the demo script, ensure all dependencies are in your PATH, and run the bash script:
```
cd tests
./run_longstitch_demo.sh
```

### Full help page
To run the LongStitch pipeline, you can use the Makefile driver script `longstitch`.
```
Usage: ./longstitch [COMMAND] [OPTION=VALUE]â€¦
	Commands:

	run     		run default LongStitch pipeline: Tigmint, then ntLink

	tigmint-ntLink-arks	run full LongStitch pipeline: Tigmint, ntLink, then ARCS in kmer mode
	tigmint-ntLink		run Tigmint, then ntLink (Same as 'run' target)
	ntLink-arks		run ntLink, then run ARCS in kmer mode

	General options (required):
	draft			draft name [draft]. File must have .fa extension
	reads			read name [reads]. The reads file can be uncompressed or gzipped.
				Accepted read file extensions: .fq, .fq.gz, .fastq, .fastq.gz, .fa, .fa.gz, .fasta, .fasta.gz
	General options (optional):
	t			number of threads [8]
	z			minimum size of contig (bp) to scaffold [1000]
	out_prefix              if supplied, final scaffolds will be soft-linked to <out_prefix>.scaffolds.fa

	Tigmint options:
	span			min number of spanning molecules to be considered correctly assembled [auto]
	dist			maximum distance between alignments to be considered the same molecule [auto]
	G			haploid genome size (bp) for calculating span parameter (e.g. '3e9' for human genome).  Required when span=auto [0]

	ntLink options:
	k_ntLink		k-mer size for minimizers [32]
	w			window size for minimizers [100]
	gap_fill	        use gap-filling feature [False]
	rounds			number of ntLink rounds [1]

	ARCS+LINKS options:
	j			minimum fraction of read kmers matching a contigId (used in kmer mode) [0.05]
	k_arks			size of a k-mer (used in kmer mode) [20]
	c			minimum aligned read pairs per molecule [4]
	l			minimum number of links to compute scaffold [4]
	a			maximum link ratio between two best contain pairs [0.3]

Notes:
	- by default, span is automatically calculated as 1/4 of the sequence coverage of the input long reads
	- G (genome size) must be specified if span=auto
	- by default, dist is automatically calculated as p5 of the input long read lengths
	- Ensure that all input files are in the current working directory, making soft-links if needed
```

## Tips for running LongStitch
### Optimizing k/w for ntLink step
* The default k (`k_ntLink`) and w (`w`) values for ntLink generally work well, but (depending on your input data) you may get better results by tuning these parameters 
* Generally, we suggest setting the k-mer and window size to values in these approximate ranges:
  * `k_ntLink` (k-mer size): 24-40
  * `w` (window size): 100-500	
* These values can be optimized using a grid search
  * For example, trying all combinations of k-mer sizes 24, 32, 40 and window sizes 100, 250, 500

### Running the default pipeline or including ARKS-long
* The default LongStitch pipeline consists of Tigmint-long + ntLink, but you can also run an additional scaffolding step with ARKS-long by specifying `tigmint-ntLink-arks` as the target in your command
* Different results from these steps are expected for different input data
  * Some datasets will show more gains with the additional scaffolding step than others
* Generally, if you want to be more conservative in terms of minimizing misassemblies and faster runtimes, the default pipeline (`run`, Tigmint-long + ntLink) is recommended. However, if you want to maximize scaffolding and contiguity, running the additional ARKS-long step (`tigmint-ntLink-arks`) is often valuable
* See the [LongStitch paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.448848) for more details and examples

### Changing parameters for minimap2
* `minimap2` is used for mapping reads in the Tigmint step
* To change the (`-x`) preset used for mapping, specify `longmap=<mode>`
  * For example, to use the nanopore mapping preset, use `longmap=ont` (default), or for PacBio use `longmap=pb`
  
### Running LongStitch in pipelines
* To change to a particular before running LongStitch, you can use the `-C dir` option with the `longstitch` command
* All input files must be in the working directory for `longstitch` - these can either be created manually or using the `longstitch make_links` command
  * This command only requires the parameters `reads_path` and `draft_path` to be set - _full_ paths to the reads file and draft fasta file, respectively
